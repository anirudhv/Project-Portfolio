		<i>BadFellas</i> is an image manipulation made to the <i>GoodFellas</i> movie poster with <b>Photoshop</b>.
		In this project, I first had a friend take four pictures of me posing like the actors
		in the original movie poster. I then imported the original movie poster into Photoshop
		followed by the four pictures taken of me. I made sure that that my photos were at a higher layer
		than the original movie poster. 
		<br />
		After this, I cropped my face from my photos, removing the background and any parts
		of my body that were visible. I applied a black and white filter to my faces and moved them on top
		of the faces of the actors in the movie poster with the corresponding facial expressions and positons.
		<br />
		As a final touch, I changed the title of the movie poster to <i>BadFellas</i> and changed the filmmaker's
		name from Martin Scorsese to my name. After all, <i>BadFellas</i> is my own creation.
		<br /> 
		Below, you can see my <i>BadFellas</i> movie poster and compare it with the original <i>GoodFellas</i> poster.
