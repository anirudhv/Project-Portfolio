		Memory Chef is a computer game I made from scratch with <b>C#</b> to manage
		the game logic and <b>XAML</b> to design the user interface. This game is a 
		<b>Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)</b> application.
		<br /><br />
		The game requires users to memorize a pizza order in 45 seconds and then create the pizza
		from memory, by choosing the dough, sauce, cheese, and toppings. 
		The final score is calculated based on how close the created pizza is to the order. 
		Pizza orders are randomized so a new order will likely be given everytime a new game is played.
		<br /><br />
		Check out a video demo of the game below or download the game .exe file to play on your computer.
